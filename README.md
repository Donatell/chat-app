# NodeJS Chat Application
[:de:](README_DE.md)

This is a real-time chat app with a client-side companion. I've built this application to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript and NodeJS. 

In this project I utilized SocketIO to establish a bidirectional and low-latency communication between the chat's browser client and ExpressJS-server.

Users can join different chat rooms and text each other. 

Technologies:

*   HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript browser front-end
*   NodeJS server with ExpressJS framework
*   SocketIO for bidirectional client and server communication

Features:

*   Create and join chat rooms
*   Set up own username
*   Text other users in the room
*   Receive system messages
*   Share own location
